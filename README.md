# Clac-AI
Calc AI is an AI-powered calculator designed to handle complex mathematical operations, solve equations, and provide step-by-step solutions. It leverages advanced algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) to interpret user inputs in natural language, making calculations intuitive and accessible for users of all levels.
Calc AI is a starter template designed to build modern React applications using TypeScript and Vite.By leveraging Viteâ€™s high-performance build system and Hot Module Replacement (HMR), developers enjoy a seamless and efficient development workflow. React 18.3 is integrated, providing the latest features and improvements for building dynamic and scalable user interfaces.
The project includes TypeScript for static typing, ensuring robust code and enhancing development efficiency. ESLint is configured with type-aware linting rules, using @typescript-eslint for advanced type-checking and eslint-plugin-react for React-specific best practices.
The configuration is extendable, allowing for strict and stylistic type checking, making the project suitable for both small prototypes and large-scale production applications.This setup offers a choice between Babel-based and SWC-based plugins for React Fast Refresh,giving developers flexibility based on their performance and tooling preferences. With minimal initial setup and a focus on quality and performance, this project provides an ideal foundation for building maintainable and high-quality React applications.
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
